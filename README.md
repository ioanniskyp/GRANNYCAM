Elderly Monitoring System 
=================================
The goal of this Proof-of-Concept (POC) project work is to verify the feasibility of using video analytics and computational intelligence algorithms with thermal camera video data for the purpose of elderly monitoring, and in more specific detecting of elderly after falling.

We are more interested in monitoring certain targeted groups of persons in need with the EMS.  We have identified the following groups as those persons in need:
•	Difficulty standing up from house furniture, such as the bed, a chair, and a couch;
•	Visibility impairment could cause falls by, e.g. a person sitting next to the toilet seat or next to a chair;
•	Neurological Disorders, such as Parkinson related syndromes which can cause falls by, e.g. prevent a person’s walking and instead block his/her legs movement;
•	Brain Disorders, such as Dementia which can cause falls by, e.g. affecting a person’s ability to correctly recognize the house furniture, and instead make him/her mistakenly sit down on the floor but being unable to stand up, again;
•	Balance disorders which can cause a person either stumbling over the house furniture, e.g. a closet or a carpet floor or leaning in an unbalanced manner over a furniture and eventually falling sown while the furniture slips on the floor;
•	Stability and Balance impairment which can cause a person, e.g. fall down as he/she tries to pick an item from the floor;
•	Medical and other health related issues, e.g. high blood pressure or diabetes, which can cause sudden fainting;
